Our project delves into the profound impact that wildfires have on various components of Earth's systems, including the atmosphere, hydrosphere, geosphere, and biosphere. Drawing inspiration from the koala, one of the species most devastated by wildfires in Australia, we introduce 'Ako', a guide who leads users on an interactive journey through the intricacies of wildfire effects on our planet. By creating an immersive, interactive website, we aim to captivate users, offering them a deep, engaging learning experience. This journey is brought to life through dynamic visualizations based on NASA data, ensuring that the information presented is both credible and impactful. Our ultimate goal is to raise awareness about why wildfire risks are increasing and how wildfires affect and are affected by the Earth's systems. Through showcasing the species at risk of extinction due to wildfires on each continent, we hope to inspire users to recognize the critical need to protect these species and the ecosystems they inhabit. This project serves as both an educational tool and a call to action, urging individuals to become stewards of the Earth and protect it from the growing threat of wildfires. By making the invisible connections between wildfires, climate, and endangered species visible, we hope to cultivate a sense of mission and responsibility in our audience, motivating them to take meaningful steps toward a more sustainable future.

Our team consists of diverse members, including a web/app junior developer, a machine learning developer, and the CEO of a biodiversity conservation advocacy startup. With this background, we are able to deliver data visualization and accurate environmental information through the web. We participate in local Albuquerque events as a legal alien from Korea. Our goal was to explain how wildfires interact with Earth's systems to create environmental issues, thereby illustrating the concept of "Imagine Our Connected Earth."

Our journey begins with Ako the koala. You can interact by clicking on the fires to put out them.


Interactive learning experience
Click on "How Wildfires Impact the Earth's System" to begin the interactive learning experience.
By selecting each system, you can learn how it interacts with the other systems. This showcases the perfect interconnectedness of Earth's systems!


A wildfire has started! Learn about its causes. Wildfires can be caused by both natural and human-made factors. In North America, many wildfires are ignited by lightning strikes. Natural causes like these contribute significantly to wildfire occurrences in the region.


Learn what happens to the Earth's four systems after a wildfire occurs. By clicking the buttons, you can explore the impacts on each system. These interactions are closely related to major environmental issues.


Endangered Animal Map
Explore the impact of wildfires on endangered species across different continents. For instance, the endangered pygmy rabbit, native to North America, faced severe consequences during the devastating 2017 Sutherland Canyon fire. The fire led to the death of 70 rabbits, and 32 more had to be evacuated, with many losing their natural habitat in the process. This tragic event highlights the vulnerability of species like the pygmy rabbit, which rely on specific ecosystems to survive. By showcasing the plight of these small, innocent creatures, we hope to not only evoke a deep sense of empathy but also to urge people to take meaningful action. Our goal is to emphasize how the devastating effects of wildfires are not just an environmental issue but a critical threat to biodiversity, especially for species already on the brink of extinction. Through these stories, we want to foster a sense of responsibility and motivate individuals to help protect and preserve these fragile ecosystems before it's too late.

The project illustrates the growing risk of wildfires due to climate change and global warming, and how these fires, in turn, exacerbate both issues in a feedback loop. As climate change and global warming progress, they cause the earth to dry out, temperatures to rise, and droughts to become more frequent. This leads to an increased risk of wildfires. As wildfires become more prevalent, they release significant amounts of greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide (CO2) and sulfur dioxide (SO4), which further accelerate climate change and global warming. 
This cycle continuously intensifies the damage caused by wildfires and the associated environmental problems. To reinforce this point, the project visualizes data on the acres burned by wildfires from the 1980s to 2024, demonstrating the alarming rise in wildfire destruction over the years. The evidence emphasizes how serious wildfire risks have become and how closely they are linked to broader environmental crises.


Wildfire Map
You can view a map of wildfire activity and CO2 emissions from January 2023 to October 2024. This visualization is powered by NASA data, which we accessed and integrated through an API
Quiz
Through the quiz, we can learn about the areas where we can make a difference and take action.

Our goal was to craft an integrated narrative, so in "How Wildfires Impact the Earth's System," users can engage with both storytelling and data in a cohesive experience. At the same time, we provided standalone access to the Wildfire Map and Endangered Animal Map, ensuring that those seeking focused data visualizations can explore the content independently, without the narrative framework.

Future Work
We aim to enhance the map by integrating additional feature data, such as humidity and biomass, which are critical factors that both influence and are affected by wildfires. By mapping these data points on a global scale, we hope to uncover more meaningful insights. Additionally, to create a more immersive experience, we are planning to develop a game. In this game, players will be tasked with preventing and extinguishing wildfires while rescuing endangered speciesâ€”all within a set budget. This concept is designed to engage users in wildfire management and conservation efforts.

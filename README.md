Our project delves into the profound impact that wildfires have on various components of Earth's systems, including the atmosphere, hydrosphere, geosphere, and biosphere. Drawing inspiration from the koala, one of the species most devastated by wildfires in Australia, we introduce 'Ako', a guide who leads users on an interactive journey through the intricacies of wildfire effects on our planet. By creating an immersive, interactive website, we aim to captivate users, offering them a deep, engaging learning experience. This journey is brought to life through dynamic visualizations based on NASA data, ensuring that the information presented is both credible and impactful. Our ultimate goal is to raise awareness about why wildfire risks are increasing and how wildfires affect and are affected by the Earth's systems. Through showcasing the species at risk of extinction due to wildfires on each continent, we hope to inspire users to recognize the critical need to protect these species and the ecosystems they inhabit. This project serves as both an educational tool and a call to action, urging individuals to become stewards of the Earth and protect it from the growing threat of wildfires. By making the invisible connections between wildfires, climate, and endangered species visible, we hope to cultivate a sense of mission and responsibility in our audience, motivating them to take meaningful steps toward a more sustainable future.

Our team consists of diverse members, including a web/app junior developer, a machine learning developer, and the CEO of a biodiversity conservation advocacy startup. With this background, we are able to deliver data visualization and accurate environmental information through the web. We participate in local Albuquerque events as a legal alien from Korea. Our goal was to explain how wildfires interact with Earth's systems to create environmental issues, thereby illustrating the concept of "Imagine Our Connected Earth."
